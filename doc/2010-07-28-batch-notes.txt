	Thoughts about Wiley batch job processing


Issues with current CPF-based implementation
	Processing runs at arbitrary times, triggered by updates
	Processing cannot be throttled
	Processing cannot be prioritized
	Does not scale well


Alternate processing model

	Timer tick drives all batch processing
		controller script is run by timer
		checks work queue for highest-priority job
		picks highest-priority job
		launches task if task slot is available
		
	Batch processing can be triggered/nudged on demand
		When trigger runs
		When UI action is taken


Design
	Batch controller script
		called periodically, from timer or on demand
		attempts to keep worker threads running
		highest priority job goes next
		How to make this cluster aware?
		Configurable:
			number of tasks to run concurrently
			interval after which a job is considered dead
			interval after which controller lock is stale
			error handler job?  (pass batch-job and exception)
			*** Need security info, which user/role to run jobs as
				List of allowed users/roles?  Allow to specify in job control file?
			*** Look into using function variables?
			
			<batch-config xmlns="urn://batch-master">
				<enabled>true</enabled>
				<max-concurrent-jobs>4</max-concurrent-jobs>
				<job-stale-interval>T30M</job-stale-interval>
				<controller-stale-interval>T2M</controller-stale-interval>
				<error-handler-job>
					...
				</error-handler-job>
			</batch-config>
			<batch-controller-lock xmlns="urn://batch-master">
				<version>1</version>
				<timestamp>2010-07-30T12:23:34</timestamp>
			</batch-controller-lock>
			
	Job runner script
		spawned asynchronously by the batch controller script
		takes a job control file as parameter
		invokes named module with job control file as arg in separate transaction
		records request id in job control file
		return value of module:
			<batch-job>: submit as new job, return arg to re-run
			(): job is done, delete job control file
			anything else: log?  What?
			{exception}: log exception/notify and delete job control file
		job control file is passed as arg, read-only

	Job control file
		must be in proper collection (urn://wiley-online-library/content/batch/job-queue)
		contained information
			module context (database, modules root, etc)
			module URI to run
			document URI to which job applies
			priority
			arbitrary options node
		Notification options?
		
		<batch-job xmlns="urn://batch-master">
			<name>Test Job 1</name>
			<priority>100</priority>
			<max-run-time>PT20M</max-run-time>
			<created>2010-08-23T14:02:53.031209+01:00</created>
			<module>/mybatch-job.xqy</module>
			<context-database>{xdmp:database()}</context-database>
			<modules-db>0</modules-db>
			<modules-root>/modules</modules-root>
			<document-uri>/mydocs/foo.xml</document-uri>
			<user>bob</user>
			<param>
				<batch-size>25</batch-size>
			</param>
		</batch-job>

	Options passed to job module
		document URI
		options node
		other context?
	
	Workflow
		job control file is created in job-queue collection
			perhaps set collection trigger to tickle batch controller?
		controller runs
			check lock file, exit if still valid
			set timestamped lock file
			determine number of available open task slots (n)
				Check that recorded request IDs are still running
			for 1 to n
				find highest priority job
				move job doc to active collection (.../running-jobs)
					set timestamp in job doc
					change collections
					commit in separate transaction
				launch task
			clear controller lock file (catch block)


	Other
		need scripts/UI to
			clear job control files
			adjust concurrent tasks
			suspend/resume jobs
			display active and queued jobs
			change priority of jobs
			display/send alerts of trouble
			display stats of jobs/minute, by priority, etc
